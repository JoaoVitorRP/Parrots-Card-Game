Second Version

Changelog:

- Changed the gif names to simplify the code;
- Added the randomize cards functionality;
- Fixed the prompt not asking the number of cards repeatedly (it was asking only once in case the requirements didn't match, instead of asking until the number was valid).

To do:

- Click count;
- Cards matching the same pair and staying flipped;
- Game ending alert;
- Timer (bonus);
- Prompt asking if the player wants to restart the game (bonus).
