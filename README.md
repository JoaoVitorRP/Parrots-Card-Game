This first version consists of the HTML and CSS, with Media Querry, and a basic JS file. The JS file does basic functions that the project requires: it flips the cards and after 1 second, unflips them, as long as 2 cards are flipped. A few bugs are yet to be corrected and some functions such as randomize the images, verify if we have a pair, etc. are yet to be added.
